# Final acceptance matrix — YouBox frontend redesign

Review environment: dev server (rsbuild :5173) + Go backend (SQLite, rate
limits disabled for the sweep), Chromium 1440×900 (mobile spot-checks at
375×812 in steps 4/7/16/17). Dark = default theme; Light verified in
step-2 (`channels-light.png`). Keyboard: skip-to-main link, focus rings
(brand), dialog/command/menu keyboard navigation verified during step 3.
Screenshots: `docs/redesign-reviews/screenshots/step-19/` unless otherwise noted.

`pass*` = visual system fully applied and verified at the shell/empty-state
level; data-populated variants (seeded models, chat presets, live streams,
fresh-install setup) re-verifiable once such data exists — all of their
components are the shared, already-verified primitives.

**Post-sweep addition — `/apps`:** the public apps-leaderboard route was
introduced after this sweep (commit `57523454`) and so is not a row above —
it did not exist at review time. It renders via `PublicLayout` and the shared
`AppsLeaderboardTable` (same component as the per-model apps tab), with
loading + dashed-empty states; typecheck clean and all six locales translated.
It has been added to `verify-harness.mjs` `PUBLIC_ROUTES` for the next harness
run; see the `/apps` section in `round2/r2-c2-final-matrix.md`.

## Final gate results

- `bun run typecheck` — pass
- `bun run lint` — 99 pre-existing react-hooks behavioral errors, 0 new
  (see step-17 review for the cross-check)
- `bun run i18n:sync` — clean (0 missing / 0 untranslated, all locales)
- `bun run build` — pass
